# SIO2SD
An Arduino-based floppy drive emulator for the atari 8 bit computers.

Instead of just buying a complete SIO2SD device, I decided to build my own using my trusty Arduino Micro. 
This seems to have just the right number of pins for the purpose as well as the necessary interfaces. 
Support for an SDCARD library is already included in the Arduino IDE.

I used my own technique to manually wire all components to a board instead of creating a PCD for which I 
do not have the proper equippment. This task is quite time-consuming but much fun nevertheless.
